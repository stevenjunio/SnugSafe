<h1 align="center">SnugSafe is the cute digital file store solution</h1>
<p>Snugsafe is the simple, secure way to store and share files with fine-tune access control for your shares. User access is controlled through simple username/passkey combinations. Simply input your username, and utilize your devices cross-platform passkey. This mean access to files are extremely secure, as they're locked to the original signing user.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
  This is a monorepo, streamlined for rapid development and scale. Thus it requires the use of Docker Compose to spin up a local server. It consists of 3 services: <ul>
    <li>
      A React app, using Vite.
    </li>
    <li>
    An <a href="https://expressjs.com"> Express.js</a> Node Server
    </li>
    <li>
      A postgres database
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  To spin up the local development server, simply hop into the root of the repo, and run <code>npm run dev</code>.
  This will spin up all services.

<h3>
  I will retain a public version of this app located at https://snugsafe.stevenjunio.com in sleeper mode, so long as hosting fees remain reasonable. **NOTE: this means the application will shut down to conserve resources while not being used. If you received timeouts, or general server errors. Please wait a minute and refresh. The servers wake up after some http activity.**
